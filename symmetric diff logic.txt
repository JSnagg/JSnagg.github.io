Symmetric difference with two arrays

1. Receive two arrays as input variables
2. Isolate a variable from the first array and compare it to every variable in the second
	-> If there is no match, add the variable from first array to a new array (XOR)
	-> If there is a match, move on to next variable
3. Isolate a variable from the second array and compare it to every variable in the first (same conditions)
4. Note: Before any variable is added to XOR, check to see that the variable is not already in XOR
5. Return new array XOR
